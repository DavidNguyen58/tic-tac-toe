# tic-tac-toe
An implementation of tic-tac-toe game with A.I engine using MinMax algorithm for the computer to find the best move in every state of the game. The algorithm is optimized with Alpha-Beta Pruning to reduce the search tree, hence increase the solving speed. In addition, the game will always be draw if the player play perfectly rational.

The skeleton code is part of the project in the course CS50 introduction to A.I with the link https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2024/projects/0/tictactoe/.
